        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying at CTU University, pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I was also a student of Bankal Elementary School, High school and Asian Learning Center Pajo. I was also a Boy Scout during my High School Days but I end it when I was in grade 8 because the leader of Boy Scout sucks and that time, almost 80% of participants quit because of bad leadership. During my time here in CTU, I try learning courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, and Web Development.</p>
